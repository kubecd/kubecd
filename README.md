This repository contains the `kubecd` tool for Kubernetes Continuous Deployment and cluster inventory.

## Configuring Environments

All the deployable environments are configured in a file called
`environments.yaml` by default. The schema for this file
[can be found here (check the `Environments` struct)](idl/github.com/zedge/kubecd/kubecd.thrift).

This file must contain two main objects, `clusters` and `environments`. Each environments maps to one
namespace in one cluster, but the environment names must be unique within this file.

Example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: prod-cluster
    provider:
      gke:
        project: example-com-prod
        clusterName: prod-cluster
        zone: us-central1-c
  - name: test-cluster
    provider:
      gke:
        project: example-com-test
        clusterName: test-cluster
        zone: us-central1-c

environments:
  - name: prod
    clusterName: prod-cluster
    kubeNamespace: default
    releasesFiles:
      - common/base-env.yaml
    defaultValues:
      - key: "image.prefix"
        value: "gcr.io/example-com-prod/"
      - key: "ingress.domain"
        value: "prod.example.com"
  - name: test
    clusterName: test-cluster
    kubeNamespace: default
    releasesFiles:
      - common/base-env.yaml
    defaultValues:
      - key: "image.prefix"
        value: "gcr.io/example-com-test/"
      - key: "ingress.domain"
        value: "test.example.com"
```

## Installing and Running

First, ensure you have Python 3.5 (run `python3 --version`).

Currently, the Python package must be installed from Zedge's artifactory
([see this page](https://zedge.work/repos/zedge-dev-tools/artifactory/#python) for how to configure Pip to fetch
packages from there):

    pip install kubecd
    kcd --help

If you are using an OS that ships only with Python 2.7 (such as Ubuntu), you can use
[pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi) to install instead, and add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:

    pip install pipsi
    pipsi install --python=python3 kubecd
    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

### Design Document

### Running From Source

This project requires Python 3.5 and Docker.

Then you need to generated Thrift source and install a shim that runs directly from your checked out source:

    pip install -e .
    make
    kcd --help

### Testing

To run tests, first install test dependencies:

    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    make test

### Making Releases

To make a new release:

 1. commit and push all changes
 2. update the `__version__` attribute in [`kubecd/__init__.py`](kubecd/__init__.py)
 3. run `python setup.py release` - this will make and push a Git tag, which will kick off the actual
    release process driven by `cloudbuild-release.yaml`
